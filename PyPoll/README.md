# PyPoll Analysis

In this Directory I have included a file called `main.py` that has the script
I created to modernize the way a town analyzes its votes. I have also
included two folders, one folder named `Resources` that holds all the election 
data in a CSV file that is labeled `election_data.csv` and another folder named 
`analysis` that will have a file created from running the script and 
this will show the results of the election and labels the file `PyPoll.txt` 

This script analyzes the CSV file in Resources folder and calculates the 
following:

- ***The total number of votes cast***
- ***A list of candidates who received votes***
- ***The percentage of votes each candidate received***
- ***The total number of votes each candidate received***
- ***The winner of the election based on votes***

Using the script I created will calculate all the above information and you will 
be able to run it in terminal or gitbash and it will return the results with the 
header "Election Analysis" and the results under, as well as export a text file 
with the results into the `analysis` folder creating the `PyPoll.txt`.
