                    #PyBank Analysis

In this Directory I have included a file called `main.py` that has the script
I created to run an analysis on the financial records of a company. I have also
included two folders, one folder named `Resources` that holds a set of financial 
data for a company in a CSV file that is labeled `budget_data.csv` and another 
folder named `analysis` that will have a file created from running the script and 
this will show the results of the anaylsis and labels the file `PyBank.txt` 

This script analyzes the CSV.file in Resources folder and calculates the 
following:

- ***The total number of months included int the dataset***
- ***The net total amount of profit and losses over the entire period***
- ***The average change in profit through that period***
- ***The greatest increase in profit and the month it occured***
- ***The greatest decrease in profit and the month it occured***

Using the script I created will calculate all the above information and you will 
be able to run it in terminal or gitbash and it will return the results with the 
header "Financial Analysis" and the results under, as well as export a text file 
with the results into the `analysis` folder creating the `PyBank.txt`.
